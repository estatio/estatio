== Trying out Estatio

=== Building Estatio

==== Prereqs

Estatio runs on Java and is built with http://maven.apache.org[Maven].
The source code is managed using https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git[git], and is held on http://github.com[github].

If you don't already have them installed, install Java (JDK 6 or later), Maven (3.0.4 or later), and git.

After that, you'll need to manually build and install the https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-rfc-2445/[google RFC-2445] Jar (this is not available in Maven Central repo).

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/jcvanderwal/google-rfc-2445.git
cd google-rfc-2445/
git checkout mavenized
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----


==== Download and build Estatio (using Intellij)

1. Go to "File" -> "New" -> "Project from version control"
2. Select "Git" in the "Version control" dropdown.
3. In the URL, copy-paste "https://github.com/estatio/estatio.git".
4. Click "Clone"
5. Wait until Intellij is done downloading and indexing all the Maven dependencies (You will see a progress bar at the bottom of the IDE).
6. Once the last step is done, click "Project" at the top left hand side.
7. Click "estatio", to make sure that it is selected.
8. Go to the menu at the top and click "Build", you should see various options "clean", "compile", "test".... If you don't see them, then it is probably because you have not selected "estatio" (top level directory of the project)
9. Click "clean" in the "Build" dropdown menu.
10. Once the last step is done, click "install". This will take a while (around 4-5 minutes) to finish.

The clone is approx 400Mb, and takes approximately 5 minutes to build.


==== Download and build Estatio

Download using git:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/estatio/estatio.git
cd estatio
----

and build using maven:

[source]
----
mvn clean install
----

The clone is approx 400Mb, and takes approximately 5 minutes to build.


=== Configure Estatio (JDBC URL)

Before Estatio can be run, you must configure its JDBC URL; typically this lives in the `estatioapp/webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/persistor.properties` properties file.

You can do this most easily by copying a set of property entries from `estatioapp/webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/persistor.properties.SAMPLE`.

For example, to run against an in-memory HSQLDB, the `persistor.properties` file should consist of:

[source]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:test
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName=sa
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword=
----

The JDBC driver for HSQLDB is on the classpath.
If you want to connect to some other database, be sure to update the `pom.xml` to add the driver as a `<dependency>`.


=== Run Estatio (using Intellij)

1. Click "Run" from the menu at the top.
2. Click "Edit Configurations".
3. Click "+" at the top left for adding a new configuration.
4. Select "Maven" from the list.
5. In the "Name" field, enter "estatio-webapp-run".
6. For the "Working Directory", select estatioapp/webapp directory.
7. In the "Command Line" field, copy-paste this "jetty:run".
8. Click on "Apply" button.
9. Click "Run" button to run this profile.


=== Run Estatio

You can run Estatio either using `mvn jetty plugin`, or using the standalone (self-hosting) version of the WAR:

* Running through Maven +
+
Run using: +
+
[source]
----
mvn -pl estatioapp/webapp jetty:run
----

* Running as a self-hosting JAR +
+
Package using: +
+
[source]
----
mvn -pl estatioapp/webapp -Dmavenmixin-jettyconsole package
----
+
and run using: +
+
[source]
----
mvn -pl estatioapp/webapp -Dmavenmixin-jettyconsole antrun:run
----


Once the app has started, browse to:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/wicket/
----

=== Using Estatio

* Login using `estatio-admin/pass` or `estatio-user/pass`.

* Install some demo fixtures (as estatio-admin):

    Prototyping > Run Fixture Script > Run script: Estatio Demo Fixture

* Run a script to setup invoices:

    Prototyping > Run Fixture Script > Run script: Generate Top Model Invoice

And take a look around :-)
