# For example, if set to 12, the title

# Encryption key is used to encrypt the rememberMe user/password.  It should be set to a unique and private value.
# If a hard-coded and publicly known value is used, then it would be possible for rememberMe user/password to be
# intercepted and decrypted, compromising access.
#
# If no value is set then (for safety) a random UUID will be used as the encryption key.  The net effect of this
# default is that 'rememberMe' will work, but only until the webapp is restarted (after which the end-user will
# have to log in again).
